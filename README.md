# Python API Challenge

## WeatherPy
Using OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data I created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
Markup : - Latitude vs. Temperature
         - Latitude vs. Humidity
         - Latitude vs. Cloudiness
         - Latitude vs. Wind Speed

I also computed the linear regression for:
Markup : - Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
         - Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
         - Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
         - Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
         - Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
         - Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
         - Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
         - Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

## VactionPy
Using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API I created a map that displays a point for every city in the city_data_df. For each city, I used the Geoapify API to find the first hotel located within 10,000 meters of the coordinates and added that information to the map.
